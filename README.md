## ✨ LOOPS IN PYHTON ✨

### Aim 🎯
To learn and study the while loop and for loop .

---

### Tools Used 🧰
- Python Interpreter to run programs  
- IDLE / VS Code to write code  
- A computer with any operating system  

---

### Theory 📘
Python is a simple and easy programming language.  
It was created by Guido van Rossum.  
Python uses simple words and clear rules, so beginners can learn it quickly.

While Loop: Repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. It is typically used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.
For Loop: Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range). It is ideal for situations where you know exactly how many times the code should run.
Break: Immediately terminates the loop.
Continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
Nested Loops: A loop inside another loop, essential for working with multi-dimensional structures like matrices.

### Advantages ✅
- Reduces the need to write the same code multiple times.
- Loops can process data structures of any size without manual adjustment.
- Control statements like break can optimize performance by exiting a search as soon as a result is found.
---

### Disadvantages ❌
- Slower than some languages
-  If the exit condition is never met, the program will run indefinitely, potentially crashing the system.
- Nested loops can significantly increase program, making it slower as the input size grows .

### Conclusion 📝
 😊👍Python is a beginner-friendly language.  
  Loops play in creating efficient and scalable Python programs.
  The while and for loops along with break and continue helps handle complex tasks😊👍
